Linux

# runtime dependencies
sudo apt install ffmpeg libsdl2-2.0.0

# client build dependencies
sudo apt install make gcc pkg-config meson ninja-build \

# server build dependencies
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

On old versions (like Ubuntu 16.04), meson is too old. In that case, install it from pip3:

sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install meson

Common steps

If you want to build the server, install the Android SDK (Android Studio), and set ANDROID_HOME to its directory. For example:

export ANDROID_HOME=~/android/sdk

If you don't want to build the server, use the prebuilt server.

Clone the project:

git clone https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy
cd scrcpy

Then, build:

meson x --buildtype release --strip -Db_lto=true
cd x
ninja

Note: ninja must be run as a non-root user (only ninja install must be run as root).

Run

To run without installing:

./run x [options]

Install

After a successful build, you can install scrcpy on the system:

sudo ninja install    # without sudo on Windows

This installs two files:

    /usr/local/bin/scrcpy
    /usr/local/share/scrcpy/scrcpy-server.jar

Just remove them to "uninstall" the application.

You can then run scrcpy.
